The solution involves understanding and adjusting the CSS rules to achieve the intended styling. In the provided example, if we wish to style paragraphs within divs using a green color, the more specific selector must be removed or modified. If the intention is to apply the style to all paragraphs within the div element, use the following:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}
```

By removing or modifying the direct child selector rule, the styles will now cascade as intended.  Always consider the specificity of CSS selectors when designing styles to avoid unexpected behavior.
